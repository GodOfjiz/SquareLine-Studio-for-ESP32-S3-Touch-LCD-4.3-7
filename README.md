-Current Issue: Export Issue with SquareLine Studio
-Fix: When exporting:
      1) Select "Export->Create Template Project"
      2) It will open up the file manager, save to your desired location
      3) After Confirming, the file manager will pop for UI export, please save at "Board Name"->__ui_project_name__->main->ui
      4) After that you will see some errors in Squareline Studio but you don't have to worry as the files have been exported

Note: After Exporting, I would suggest to rename __ui_project_name__ to your desired project name
